***WordleHelper***
This is a simple Wordle tool. Enter your guess in to the first row, click second row of boxes to match the colors Wordle gives you in response. The list of possible words narrows as you go.

*Build Instructions*
I'm not using any special libraries or anything. It's just .NET 5 with WPF. If you have that, you should be able to build this.
